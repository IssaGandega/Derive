## About

Dérive is an ALT.CTRL / Arcade game developped in 6 months by a team of 8 students and presented at GDC in 2022

## Alternative Controller

Dérive being an alt.ctrl project, we decided to transform the arcade terminal into a boat, where a rudder and cranks would allow players to influence the in-game boat.

## List of mechanics

| Name             | Description     |
| :--:|:------:|
| **Controller** | The controller is similar to that of a classic arcade machine, with the addition of a rudder and cranks. These different elements had to be managed with Uduino, an interface that passes information from an arduino chip to Unity.|
| **Local Multiplayer** | The game can only be played in local cooperation on a terminal that the team has built.|
| **Weapons** | Players have 3 weapons at their disposal: a hammer, a sword and a boxing glove. Each weapon has different stats, making them more or less effective against each other. | 
| **Traps** | Traps are placed on the boat and can be activated by players to gain an advantage; players must use their crank to escape from a trap. |
